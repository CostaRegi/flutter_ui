Some ui challenges
**UI Challenges build in flutter**
This are a series of ui that I've put together meanwhile practicing flutter;

**Challenge 1.** - this first challenge is inspired by a ui that can be found [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/3691930-Sign-in-and-Sign-up-views-dark-theme). It's a implementation of a login and signup page

The full implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/CostaRegi/flutter_ui/tree/feature/challenge_1)
